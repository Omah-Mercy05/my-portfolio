               <p><b>Animal Habitation</b><br>This was my very first html/css project its an image gallery that displays pictures of animals. it also contains a link that takes you to a page where you get to see more </p>
               <p>I used this website to know and implement some cool stylings using CSS </p>
               <p>My aim at this stage was to know about these animation, and transitions and to use them better in projects that i will design in future!.</p>
