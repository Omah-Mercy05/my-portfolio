    <h1>Dog-Man's Best Friend.</h1>
   <P>In a small town,there lived a lonely old man named Sam. He had no family or friends, except for his faithful dog, Bingo. Bingo was always there for mr Sam,wagging its tail and providing companionship.</P>
   <p>One day,mr Sam fell ill and was bedridden. Bingo refused to leave his side, offering comfort and warmth. As days passed, Mr Sam recovered. Thanks to bingo's unwavering Presence. </p>
<p>Mr Sam's neighbors were amazed by the bond between Man and dog. News spread, and soon, others within Mr Sam's neighborhood adopted dogs,  finding solace in their loyal companions</p>
<p>Bingo became a symbol of love and friendship, reminding everyone that a Dog truly is Man's best friend.   </p>
